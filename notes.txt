The query post is a function which wp calls by itself.
Editing the query post allows us to generate the content when ever we want.
What if we only want the most revient or only 3 or 4 post returned or just post in a specific category?

if we use WP_Query, we create a new query that does not touch the main Query_Post Loop of WP.

We create an empty query without destroying the main loop.

The query can access any element that is in the database and return that like any mySQL Query.

$lastBost = new WP_Query(type=post&post_per-page=1);
A standard php thing is to inject -> what we have created into a function/

$lastBlog->have_post()

note that he switched from index.php to page-home.php to demonstrate the difference/

There WP_QUERY and GET POST FUNCTION

To edit the home page you need to create another file so WP can access the page
create:

page-home

remember you can create a slug page or id of the page

OK REMEMBER THIS.

We want to create seperate querys on the HOME page. Perviously, the home page was accessed by WP through
index.php (common sense) BUT WP also is a framework which will look for slugs ( which are urls of the
page in question) and if that slug exists - will show that page instead. So  the slug to the home page is:
Permalink: http://modrakin.com/awesome/home/
and if you create a new file called
page-home.php

the wp framework will get page-home.php and use that page instead of HTML.

so we are going to use page-home.php to make our three queries to the database to display
three results.

on page-home:
1. Just return one post.
2. Return Two Post, minus the first post.
3. Return only post with Category named News.

and seperately: on our BLOG.php page ( created in the admin area --- not via text editor and FTP ) we are
leaving the original WP_Query to default,

Ok?

////Lesson 10///////
Styling.
We want to get some different styles for the top three post we are returning on page-home.php

We can put our style directly into the loop. Or create a template to surround what is inside the loop/

if():
while():the_post();


<?php get_template_part('content', get_post_format() ); ?>


<?php
endwhile:
endif;
?>


We are going to put all our mark up in another file called content-featured.php
so we need to change the markup to featured, WP FRAMEWORK will know how to attach this...( see video 7)
<?php get_template_part('content', featured ); ?>

So in the content-featured.php we can customize the presentation of our FEATURED POST!

copy stuff from content.php into content-featured.php

This makes sense, because content.php is the fallback, the default if there is no
option after that mark up - and this is the standard, the default when a user creates a
new post and does not select any of the others we might have activated. ( image ... etc )

OK...
If I want to limit the categories which show up, because wp selects the latest categories
no matter what the category it is in, even uncategorized. How do we filter out certain
categories? THis is not the same as including a category, because you want to have ALL
CATEGORIES show up except for a certain one. Like maybe you want to fileter articles about
SEX, if you have a wp site for kids?

$args = array(
                'type' => 'post',
                'posts_per_page' => 3,
                'category__in' => array(7,8,9), // sometimes customers select multiple categories 7,10,1 ?
                'category__not_in' => array(1,10), // not_in does not display these categories even if selected

Ok, How do you just display the last blog post of each category.
I want to recall one single post of each category - even if there are more than one post in this category.

OK, you have to think like mySQL the GROUP BY and HAVING functions, but do it in WP Template
$args = array(
                'type' => 'post',
                'posts_per_page' => 3,
                'category__in' => array(7,8,9),
                'category__not_in' => array(1,10),
