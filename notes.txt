The query post is a function which wp calls by itself.
Editing the query post allows us to generate the content when ever we want.
What if we only want the most revient or only 3 or 4 post returned or just post in a specific category?

if we use WP_Query, we create a new query that does not touch the main Query_Post Loop of WP.

We create an empty query without destroying the main loop.

The query can access any element that is in the database and return that like any mySQL Query.

$lastBost = new WP_Query(type=post&post_per-page=1);
A standard php thing is to inject -> what we have created into a function/

$lastBlog->have_post()

note that he switched from index.php to page-home.php to demonstrate the difference/

There WP_QUERY and GET POST FUNCTION

To edit the home page you need to create another file so WP can access the page
create:

page-home

remember you can create a slug page or id of the page

OK REMEMBER THIS.

We want to create seperate querys on the HOME page. Perviously, the home page was accessed by WP through
index.php (common sense) BUT WP also is a framework which will look for slugs ( which are urls of the
page in question) and if that slug exists - will show that page instead. So  the slug to the home page is:
Permalink: http://modrakin.com/awesome/home/
and if you create a new file called
page-home.php

the wp framework will get page-home.php and use that page instead of HTML.

so we are going to use page-home.php to make our three queries to the database to display
three results.

on page-home:
1. Just return one post.
2. Return Two Post, minus the first post.
3. Return only post with Category named News.

and seperately: on our BLOG.php page ( created in the admin area --- not via text editor and FTP ) we are
leaving the original WP_Query to default,

Ok?

Styling.
We want to get some different styles for the top three post we are returning on page-home.php

We can put our style directly into the loop. Or create a template to surround what is inside the loop/

if():
while():the_post();


<?php get_template_part('content', get_post_format() ); ?>


<?php
endwhile:
endif;
?>
